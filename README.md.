This project is an Employee Entry Tracking System that combines facial recognition, geofencing, Twilio integration, and MongoDB to ensure secure and automated attendance management. The system uses facial recognition to verify employee identity at entry points, while geofencing ensures that check-ins only happen within authorized office premises. Twilio is integrated to send real-time SMS/alerts to managers for each entry or suspicious activity. All employee data, logs, and facial embeddings are stored in MongoDB, providing a scalable and reliable database solution. This project offers organizations a modern, automated, and tamper-proof way of managing employee attendance and security.
